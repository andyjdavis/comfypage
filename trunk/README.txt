QUICK INSTALL
=============

Here is a basic outline of the installation process, which normally takes only a few minutes:

1) Put the ComfyPage files in your web directory.

2) Make sure your web server user has permission to write to the /site directory (use chmod in linux)

3) Visit your ComfyPage site in a browser and log in using the default login details.
Username: you@example.com
Password: password

4) Go through the site creation wizard.

5) Go to the Site Manager (the spanner icon in the toolbar), click on Account and change the admin email address and password.

Good luck and have fun!
